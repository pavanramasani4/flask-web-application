Here’s a `README.md` file specifically for your Flask web application that uses SQLite for database management:

# Flask Web Application with SQLite Database

## Overview

This project is a Flask web application that allows users to sign up, log in, and manage their sessions. It uses a SQLite database to store user information securely and implements password hashing. The application also includes session management and user feedback through flash messages.

## Features

- **User Registration and Authentication**: Secure user sign-up and login functionality.
- **Session Management**: Users can log in and out, with session tracking.
- **Password Hashing**: Secure storage of passwords using hashing.
- **Flash Messages**: User feedback for actions like login errors or successful registration.
- **SQLite Database**: Lightweight database for storing user data.

```

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.9 or higher**
- **SQLite**: Included with Python, no need for separate installation.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/my-flask-app.git
cd my-flask-app
```

Replace `your-username` with your GitHub username.

### 2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

```sh
python -m venv venv
```

- On Windows:

  ```sh
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

- On macOS/Linux:

  ```sh
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Set Up the Database

The application uses SQLite. The database will be created automatically when you run the app for the first time.

### 5. Run the Application

```sh
python Week1.py
```

The application will start running on `http://localhost:5000`.

## Usage

- **Sign Up**: Navigate to `/signup` to create a new account.
- **Log In**: Use your credentials at `/login` to access your account.
- **Home Page**: After logging in, you'll be redirected to the home page.
- **Log Out**: Click the logout button to end your session.

## Project Details

### Week1.py

This is the main application file containing the Flask routes and application logic.

**Key Routes:**

- `/`: Home page (login form)
- `/signup`: Sign-up page
- `/submit_signup`: Handles sign-up form submission
- `/login`: Handles login form submission
- `/home`: User's home page after logging in
- `/logout`: Logs the user out

### Templates

- **index.html**: The login page template.
- **signup.html**: The sign-up page template.
- **home.html**: The user's home page template.
- **user.html**: Displays all users (for demonstration purposes).

### Static Files

- **styles.css**: Contains styling for the login and sign-up pages.
- **home-styles.css**: Contains styling for the home page.

### Database

- **SQLite**: The application uses SQLite for simplicity. The database file `mydatabase.db` is created automatically.

## Requirements.txt

Contains the Python dependencies for the application.

```text
Flask==2.0.2
Werkzeug==2.0.2
Jinja2==3.0.2
itsdangerous==2.0.1
click==8.0.3
```

Add any additional dependencies your application requires.

## Environment Variables

Ensure that the `secret_key` in `Week1.py` is set to a secure random value in production.

```python
app = Flask(__name__)
app.secret_key = 'your_secret_key'  # Replace with a secure key in production
```
